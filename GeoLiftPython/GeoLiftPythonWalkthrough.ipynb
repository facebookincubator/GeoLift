Moreover, after observing that the historical KPI values in `GeoPlot()` have been stable across time we will proceed with a model with Fixed Effects.

    "\n",
    "While most of the times the objective of a Multi-Cell test is simply to accurately measure the incremental effect of different channels/strategies, sometimes we want to go a step further and declare which one of the competing cells is statistically significantly better or worse than the others. In this case, we can use the `MultiCellWinner` function, to determine what must happen for a cell to be declared a **“Winner”**. This function works by answering the following question: for a given baseline Effect Size, how much better must the incremental Return on Ad Spend (iROAS) of a cell be so that it provides a statistically significantly better Lift overall?"
