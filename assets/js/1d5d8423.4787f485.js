As explained in further detail in [our Blueprint Course](https://www.facebookblueprint.com/student/path/253063), the GeoLift Market Selection process simulates a large number of geo experiments to determine which is the best test and control setup for you.\\n\\nIn each simulation a **treatment effect** is applied over a **treatment group** during the **treatment period**. Then, GeoLift then trains a **counterfactual** for the treatment group by using all of **the pre-treatment periods** prior to the experiment to assess the model\'s performance.  Let\u2019s breakdown each of these five components:\\n\\n* **The treatment effect**: is the Lift percentage that will be applied to a set of locations during the testing period.\\n* **The treatment group**: these are a set of locations that will be exposed to the treatment effect.\\n* **The counterfactual**: these are a set of locations that are used to estimate what would have happened to the treatment group if it had not been exposed to the treatment effect.  An easy way to think about it is as a weighted average of all the locations that are not part of the treatment group.\\n* **The treatment period**: represents the moments in which the treatment group will be exposed to the treatment.\\n* **The pre-treatment period**: this refers to the amount of periods that will be used to build the counterfactual, where there was no simulated difference between locations.  During this period, the counterfactual and the treatment group should have a similar behavior.\\n\\nApplying different effects to the same group in the same period allows us to holistically determine what the Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE) for that setup will be.  Among other metrics, this helps us understand whether we are dealing with a combination of locations that will have a higher likelihood of observing small effect sizes. However, seasonalities and variations throughout time make can difficult to estimate the MDE with complete certainty.  Fortunately, we can reduce this uncertainty by taking a look at the past!\\n\\n## Introducing the lookback window parameter.\\n\\nOur first simulation uses the most recent/latest periods in our series as our **treatment period** and all of the remaining periods as our **pre-treatment period**.  This gives us the metrics we need to rank treatment groups for those time periods.\\n\\nAs stated in our [GeoLift Walkthrough](https://facebookincubator.github.io/GeoLift/docs/GettingStarted/Walkthrough), we can increase the number of simulated time periods by changing the `lookback_window`.  The `lookback_window` indicates how far back in time the simulations for the power analysis will go.  By increasing the `lookback_window`, we subtract the last period from the previous simulation\u2019s total duration and repeat the process over the remaining periods.  Finally, we calculate the average metrics for each treatment group over all of the runs in different periods.\\n\\nFor example, imagine we have a 90 day long series with different locations and we would like to simulate a 15 day test, with a 2 day `lookback_window`.\\n\\n* In the first simulation, the **treatment period** is made up of the most recent dates and Lift is simulated on it.  The remainder, the **pre-treatment period**, is used to build a counterfactual.  So, with a test duration of 15 days, for this iteration we use periods 1 to 75 as a **pre-treatment period** and periods 76 to 90 as a **treatment period**.\\n* For our second simulation, the treatment period is shifted by one timestamp.  We use periods 1 to 74 as a pre-treatment period and periods 75 to 89 as a **treatment period**.\\n* We then construct average metrics per each **treatment group**, using these two simulations.  In essence, we are repeating this flow until the number of time periods shifted is equal to the `lookback_window` parameter.\\n\\n![lookbackwindow](https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/blob/main/website/static/img/lookback_1.png?raw=true)\\n\\nIn this context, more simulations allow us to have a more robust estimate of the metrics for each **treatment group**, observing if the same behavior occurs across different simulated **treatment** and **pre-treatment periods**.  The intuitive idea here is that we would like to capture some of the variability in the time series in our test setups, to avoid assuming something that could be different in the future.\\n\\n\\n## There\u2019s a tradeoff: robustness vs preciseness\\n\\nThe more we look back into the past, the more simulations per **treatment group** we will have.  This will make our estimates more robust and allow us to make safer predictions with regard to the pre-test metrics.\\n\\nHowever, the more we look back into the past, the less precise our simulation will be as compared to the actual result.  Removing the last periods we have prior to the test leads to two major effects:\\n\\n* Our simulations become less precise because they have a smaller amount of periods to build the counterfactual than what the actual experiment will have.\\n* The accuracy of our simulation will be reduced since we are shortening the time that is being considered by the algorithm\u2019s pre-treatment period.\\n\\n![lookback_tradeoff](https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/blob/main/website/static/img/lookback_2.png?raw=true)\\n\\nGiven this tradeoff, we need to choose the amount of simulations we run considering the potential they have but keeping in mind that they also have a downside. Moreover, it is important to note that incresing the `lookback_window` parameter will exponentially increase the number of simulations performed in the Market Selection algorithm and will result in a longer runtime.\\n\\n## How to choose the best `lookback_window`?\\n\\nThe best way to analyze this problem is to capture the variance of detected effects in the same simulated **treatment period** for different **treatment group** combinations.\\n\\nWe have run this analysis using the dummy dataset that is available within the GeoLift package (`data(GeoLift_PreTest)`).  This dataset is similar to the example we showed above: it has a total of 90 days of pre-experiment data, and we will simulate a test that will last 15 days.  If we assume that there was no preexisting difference between locations, then the median of detected effects for each test start period should be around zero, which is the true effect.\\n\\n![Simulations_lookback](https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/blob/main/website/static/img/lookback_3.png?raw=true)\\n\\n_The plot on the left shows the standard deviation of the detected effect per treatment start period. The plot on the right shows the range of detected effects for different treatment groups._\\n\\nAs we can see from the plot in the left, the standard deviation of the detected effect has a continuous drop from period 67 onwards.  From the second plot, we can also observe that the median effect is close to zero, especially in the last periods.\\n\\n## Putting it in practice\\n\\nSince we have 75 pre-treatment periods in total, and the drop in standard deviation occurs in period 67, we would set a `lookback_window` of 8 periods.\\n\\nTo be as efficient as possible, we suggest running the GeoLiftMarketSelection function to find the best combination of markets with a `lookback_window=1`.  With those best candidates, do a deep dive with a longer `lookback_window=8` for each treatment combination by running GeoLiftPower, plot and analyze their power curves.\\n\\n## In conclusion\\n\\nThe `lookback_window` parameter is a fundamental element of a robust Power Analysis and Market Selection. As a best practice, we recommend running a data-driven analysis similar to the one that was showcased here to identify the ideal value for this parameter. Alternatively, **a great rule of thumb is to keep 1/10 of the pre-treatment periods for simulations, once the test duration has been defined**. So, if you have a total of 150 periods before your experiment, and you want to run a 10 day test, a total of 140 pre-treatment periods would remain.  Following this rule, you would have to set a `lookback_window=14` for the preferred options that come out of the GeoLiftMarketSelection ranking.\\n\\nAt the very least,  we suggest setting the `lookback_window` to a value that is at least as large as the time-series\u2019 most granular seasonality (if we observe that sales vary widely throughout the days of the week, then setting the `lookback_window` to 7 would be a good start).\\n\\n## What\u2019s up next?\\n\\nStay tuned for our next blog posts, related to topics like:\\n\\n* When should I use Fixed Effects to get a higher signal to noise ratio?\\n* When should our GeoLift test start?"},{"id":"Python","metadata":{"permalink":"/GeoLift/blog/Python","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/blog/2022-08-11-Python.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-08-11-Python.md","title":"Introducing GeoLift in Python","description":"Introduction","date":"2022-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 11, 2022","tags":[{"label":"GeoLift","permalink":"/GeoLift/blog/tags/geo-lift"},{"label":"Geo Measurement","permalink":"/GeoLift/blog/tags/geo-measurement"},{"label":"Python","permalink":"/GeoLift/blog/tags/python"},{"label":"R","permalink":"/GeoLift/blog/tags/r"}],"readingTime":1.355,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jussan Da Silva","title":"Marketing Science @ Meta | GeoLift Team","url":"https://github.com/JussanN/","imageURL":"https://github.com/JussanN.png","key":"jussan"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"Python","title":"Introducing GeoLift in Python","authors":["jussan"],"tags":["GeoLift","Geo Measurement","Python","R"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Enter into the time capsule - Determining Lookback Window","permalink":"/GeoLift/blog/lookback_window"},"nextItem":{"title":"Multi-Cell Experiments with GeoLift","permalink":"/GeoLift/blog/MultiCell"}},"content":"## Introduction\\n\\nToday we released a [tutorial](https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/tree/GeoLiftPython) explaining how to run an end-to-end implementation of GeoLift in Python leveraging the `rpy2` package.

However, advertising effects are rarely instantaneous.  Certain actions have longer conversion cycles and will require continued monitoring after campaigns complete to assess their impacts in full.  We explore the usage of post test conversion windows to measure these lagged effects and some of the considerations advertisers should take when thinking about using them.\\n\\n## What is a post test conversion window and why do we use them?\\nA post test conversion window is an interval of time after the completion of an experiment where we continue to track conversions to account for delayed impacts of our advertising efforts.  If the time it takes for our customers to take a desired action significantly lags when they view our advertisement, we can append this window and monitor our desired event after the experiment concludes.\\n\\nPost test conversion windows can also be used as a cooldown period between testing different strategies.  They help us run cleaner experiments knowing we are closer to steady-state performance without the lagged effects of other campaigns.\\n\\n> Jasper\u2019s Market, a fictional retailer, needed to understand the value of their upcoming marketing campaign.  They plan on running a month-long campaign and know they have a typical purchase cycle of three weeks.  In other words, it takes their customers an average of three weeks from when they see an advertisement to physically going to the store and making a purchase.  Jasper\u2019s Market felt that they would not be able to fully capture the impact of their marketing efforts by just measuring when their campaign is live, so they decided to append a post test conversion window to their experiment to measure the delayed effects of their campaign.\\n\\n## When should we include a post test conversion window?\\nWhen deciding to include a post test conversion window, we are balancing two different forces.  On one hand we want to incorporate the lagged effects of our advertising efforts, better representing the complete impact of the campaign, while simultaneously trying to avoid introducing noise into the experimental analysis and potentially diluting the impact of our campaign.\\n\\nTo balance this in our favor, it makes sense to incorporate a post test conversion window when the marketing campaign effects we are measuring occur well after the advertisement is delivered.  The shorter the duration of the campaign relative to the time it typically takes for the conversion to occur (purchase cycle) the more likely we will benefit from including this window.\\n\\n## How do we determine the optimal length?\\nWe can start by fixing the post test conversion window to the duration of our typical purchase cycle.  We can then measure the daily incremental conversion volume or average treatment effect on treated (ATT) over both the test period and the post test conversion window to determine the incremental impact of the test.\\n\\nTo determine the optimal duration for future tests, we can take note of how long it takes for test and control geographies to reconverge after the campaign treatment ends and set that as the duration going forward.  In some instances, the test and control populations might not reconverge exactly.  For these cases, we could determine a \u2018Region of Practical Equivalence\u2019 (ROPE) for the ATT and if the discrepancy falls within that range, we can change the post test conversion duration.  If the discrepancy is large however, we should inspect the individual geographies and ensure no unusual events occurred within any of the test or control locations and possibly repeat the experiment before assuming the effect goes into perpetuity.\\n\\n> Jasper\u2019s Market decided to launch their geo-experiment with a post conversion window of three weeks.  By doing this they ensure they will capture the lagged effects of their marketing efforts.  After the experiment ended, they continued monitoring their ATT.  As they had suspected, the gap between test and control did not immediately close after the experiment but continued for an additional two weeks before reconverging back to a negligible level.   Had they stopped monitoring the results after the end of the campaign they would have fully captured the impact of their efforts.  Having the post conversion window also helped them identify the amount of time needed after the campaign ended to run their next experiment without the fear of contamination.\\n\\n## Viewing Post Test Conversion Windows in GeoLift\\nWe recently added a small change to version 2.4.32, which allows the user to input the number of periods included as a post test conversion window.   This update has been added to both the absolute Lift and the ATT plots.\\nWithin Lift you can include a \u2018post_test_treatment_periods\u2019 which will allow you to view the Treatment and Post Treatment periods in different colors.\\n\\n![LaggedEffectsLift](https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/blob/main/website/static/img/LaggedEffects_Lift.png?raw=true)\\n\\nAdditionally in the ATT plot you can also include the \u2018post_test_treatment_periods\u2019 and a ROPE = TRUE parameter which will delineate the post_treatment window and show you the region of practical equivalence defined as between 10% and 90% quantiles for the ATT prior to the experiment.\\n\\n![LaggedEffectsLift](https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/blob/main/website/static/img/LaggedEffects_ATT.png?raw=true)\\n\\n## Final Thoughts\\nWhen measuring the impact of your next advertising campaign, consider adding a post test conversion window to capture the lagged effects of your marketing efforts. The longer the purchase cycle for your product the more crucial it is that you incorporate one in your analysis. In addition to helping with measurement the cooldown period will also ensure you are ready to launch your next experiment on a blank slate without contamination of your prior campaign.\\n\\n## What\u2019s up next?\\n\\nStay tuned for our next blog posts, related to topics like:\\n\\n* Calibrating your MMM model with GeoLift.\\n* When should I use Fixed Effects to get a higher signal to noise ratio?\\n* When should our GeoLift test start?"},{"id":"blueprint-geolift","metadata":{"permalink":"/GeoLift/blog/blueprint-geolift","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/blog/2022-06-06-Blueprint.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-06-06-Blueprint.md","title":"GeoLift Blueprint Course by Meta","description":"Blueprint","date":"2022-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 6, 2022","tags":[{"label":"GeoLift","permalink":"/GeoLift/blog/tags/geo-lift"},{"label":"Geo Measurement","permalink":"/GeoLift/blog/tags/geo-measurement"}],"readingTime":1.215,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Arturo Esquerra","title":"Marketing Science @ Meta | GeoLift Team","url":"https://github.com/ArturoEsquerra/","imageURL":"https://github.com/ArturoEsquerra.png","key":"arturo"},{"name":"Nicolas Cruces","title":"Marketing Science @ Meta | GeoLift Team","url":"https://github.com/NicolasMatrices-v2","imageURL":"https://github.com/NicolasMatrices-v2.png","key":"nicolas"},{"name":"Michael Khalil","title":"Marketing Science @ Meta | GeoLift Team","url":"https://github.com/michael-khalil","imageURL":"https://github.com/michael-khalil.png","key":"michael"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"blueprint-geolift","title":"GeoLift Blueprint Course by Meta","authors":["arturo","nicolas","michael"],"tags":["GeoLift","Geo Measurement"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Measuring Lagged Effects using GeoLift","permalink":"/GeoLift/blog/LaggedEffects"},"nextItem":{"title":"Inverse GeoLift - inference done cheaper","permalink":"/GeoLift/blog/inverse-geolift"}},"content":"![Blueprint](https://facebook-cdn.exceedlms.com/uploads/resource_hero_pictures/targets/603247/w2400/2400-x-650.png?Policy=eyJTdGF0ZW1lbnQiOlt7IlJlc291cmNlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9mYWNlYm9vay1jZG4uZXhjZWVkbG1zLmNvbS91cGxvYWRzL3Jlc291cmNlX2hlcm9fcGljdHVyZXMvdGFyZ2V0cy82MDMyNDcvdzI0MDAvMjQwMC14LTY1MC5wbmciLCJDb25kaXRpb24iOnsiRGF0ZUxlc3NUaGFuIjp7IkFXUzpFcG9jaFRpbWUiOjE2NTQ1NDY3OTh9fX1dfQ__&Signature=DXer4smR166~jI0jTqOkQUTKAd2tK2LhYVNa0H0qJ7iPsaJNAQNHxOLEwdbt~4lY0rUA5xhPQyYJWsgT9uwgUKvu33inf0SKAGvDCN2bfdfOWuwx1Na0ByjojRPWgBKZD3V43IvpGqq-zdtU4h9BJ4qh5btYF172hMcNciOQbPDLRurT55Nx0IdJpvRq09dZqOzK22-Eoa3B0kOqL5y4UzIbgw0MjIjj2sSpu2tCTpCoHjxQ6gzZQ~1ecdfFY7B1kC52kPmBFYrREjN6DQvELBKmxYfbukVSaD5YO34dUYOTzuxIecgHPpjy97VOueh6Zu1MjpEbLi0SWHCvYnBigg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJINUZDMKZJI5I6DA)\\n\\n## New GeoLift Course by Meta Blueprint\\n\\nWe are excited to share the launch of our new self-paced step-by-step tutorial to teach you how to run geo-experiments with GeoLift!\\n\\nGeo experimentation can help advertisers establish causal relationships between their marketing efforts and a business outcome.

This is what we call a counterfactual.  The latter is built off of control locations that will not be exposed to the treatment effect and paired as close as possible to the treatment group, prior to the test.\\n- **It\u2019s transparent.**  Being an open source package [hosted on Github](https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift), the code is freely available for everyone to use and inspect.\\n- **It sets you up for success.**  There are many packages that help you analyze geographical quasi-experiments.  There\u2019s only one that runs power analysis via simulations to help the user define where the treatment should be applied, on top of the standard analysis module.\\n- It\u2019s based on [cutting-edge econometric models](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.2021.1929245).\\n\\nIn order to construct a robust counterfactual, GeoLift usually requires more than half the amount of available locations to be part of the control group.  This is because the counterfactual is created as a linear combination of the units in the pool of controls, therefore, richer pools tend to provide more robust counterfactuals.  Standard GeoLifts can be a great setup when you are trying to measure the positive effect that new media has on your business.\\n\\nHowever, **it can be detrimental to run an experiment with a large holdout when you would like to measure ongoing media efforts**.  This has to do with the opportunity cost of running a test.  When you are holding out media from certain locations, your total KPI will decrease by the effect that media has in those locations, scaled by the size of the holdout.\\n\\n![OppCost](https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/blob/main/website/static/img/OppCost.png?raw=true)\\n\\n## A new hope\\n\\nA great way to reduce holdout size without compromising experiment accuracy is to **flip GeoLift on its head**: instead of showing media to the treatment group and holding out the control group, you holdout the treatment group and show media to the control group.  This is what we refer to as an Inverse GeoLift.\\n\\n![InverseTable](https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/blob/main/website/static/img/InverseLiftTable.png?raw=true)\\n\\nInverse GeoLifts have a different interpretation than Standard GeoLifts.  Instead of measuring the contribution that media is having on the treatment locations, you are measuring the opportunity cost that holding out media has on the treatment locations.\\n\\nThe main assumption here is that positive and negative effects are interchangeable.  In other words, if you would run a Standard or an Inverse GeoLift, the only thing that would change is the sign of the effect, not its absolute value.  **Don\u2019t worry**: when setting up a GeoLift and deciding which is the best treatment group for the experiment, the difference between the detected effect and the true effect is a variable that we are taking into account to rank different location combinations. Treatment setups that have a low difference are preferred and will be highly ranked.  [Check here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/blob/main/vignettes/GeoLift_Walkthrough.md#power-analysis) to see what the ranking variables look like in our Walkthrough.\\n\\n![TypesGeoLift](https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/blob/main/website/static/img/TypesGeoLift.png?raw=true)\\n\\n## Tips for building and analyzing an Inverse GeoLift\\n\\n### Determine budget for the test.\\n\\nAs long as you know your Cost Per Incremental Conversion (CPIC), Standard GeoLifts will tell you the minimum budget that you should invest in the treatment group.  For Inverse GeoLifts, we have to interpret the budget suggestion as the minimum amount of money that should be taken away from the treatment group.  You can see these values in the `Investment` column from the output of `GeoLiftMarketSelection`.\\n\\nIf your treatment group is currently investing less than the required budget, then it will be hard to detect an effect, given that the CPIC is accurate.  You should try to select treatment setups that have a current investment that is below the absolute value of the required budget.  If there are no feasible options,  we suggest increasing the budget for all markets within the control group to ensure that the minimum amount of investment in the treatment group is met.  While this could change Business As Usual media circumstances, it becomes necessary in order to run a well-powered experiment. A good ad hoc rule for these cases is to compute the extra budget needed by calculating the difference between the required budget and the current investment in treatment and scaling that by the treatment investment share over total investment.  This will give you the value that you need to put up to run a successful experiment.\\n\\n![ExtraInvestment](https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/blob/main/website/static/img/ExtraInvestment.png?raw=true)\\n\\n### Keep an eye on the weights for the counterfactual.\\n\\nWhen setting up the test, you can access the weights for each of the control locations with the `GetWeights()` method.  This will show you how each of the locations that will not be treated (shown media ads) will be weighted within the counterfactual.\\n\\nWhen running an Inverse GeoLift, it\u2019s important to guarantee that you will show media ads in these locations.  If available, you can validate this by getting an investment report by location and ensuring that all locations with a positive weight in the counterfactual from GeoLift are being shown ads.  If this condition is not met, we could be observing a very small treatment effect due to dilution of media within the control group, when the real treatment effect could be large.\\n\\n### Look for symmetric power curves\\n\\nA symmetric power curve with respect to the y axis will guarantee that there are no considerable differences for a particular setup when changing from a Standard to an Inverse GeoLift.  This is another guarantee that our assumptions for these types of tests hold.  You can visualize this by running the `GeoLiftPower()` function with positive and negative effects, a larger `lookback_window` and plotting its output.  You can check for examples of what it should look like in our Github Walkthrough.\\n\\n### Calculate the Treatment\u2019s CPIC\\n\\nAt the end of your experiment, you will want to know how much each incremental action in the treatment group cost.  Since you did not invest in the treatment, you need to estimate the budget in that group.  In order to do so, you can calculate the sum of GeoLift weights from the counterfactual and multiply them by the investment per location in the control.  Dividing it by the incremental conversions will give you the Cost Per Incremental Conversion.\\n\\n![CPIC](https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/blob/main/website/static/img/CPICEquation.png?raw=true)\\n\\nWhere t0 represents the last pre-treatment time-stamp, T represents the treatment end, and N represents the number of units in the pool of controls.\\n\\n## What\u2019s up next?\\n\\nStay tuned for our next blog posts, related to topics like:\\n\\n- Calibrating your MMM model with GeoLift.\\n- What should my lookback window be?\\n- When should our GeoLift test start?\\n\\n## Want to try out your first Inverse GeoLift?\\n\\nInstall our Github package by [following this link](https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift#installing-geolift), or join our Facebook Group if you have further questions on our open source tool!"},{"id":"geolift-v23","metadata":{"permalink":"/GeoLift/blog/geolift-v23","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/blog/2022-03-03-GeoLiftv23.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-03-03-GeoLiftv23.md","title":"Launching GeoLift v2.3 - Streamlined and Improved Power Calculations","description":"GeoLift v2.3 Release","date":"2022-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 3, 2022","tags":[{"label":"GeoLift","permalink":"/GeoLift/blog/tags/geo-lift"},{"label":"Geo Measurement","permalink":"/GeoLift/blog/tags/geo-measurement"},{"label":"SCM","permalink":"/GeoLift/blog/tags/scm"},{"label":"ASCM","permalink":"/GeoLift/blog/tags/ascm"}],"readingTime":2.715,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Arturo Esquerra","title":"Marketing Science @ Meta | GeoLift Team","url":"https://github.com/ArturoEsquerra/","imageURL":"https://github.com/ArturoEsquerra.png","key":"arturo"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"geolift-v23","title":"Launching GeoLift v2.3 - Streamlined and Improved Power Calculations","authors":["arturo"],"tags":["GeoLift","Geo Measurement","SCM","ASCM"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Inverse GeoLift - inference done cheaper","permalink":"/GeoLift/blog/inverse-geolift"},"nextItem":{"title":"A Brief Review of Geo Measurement Approaches","permalink":"/GeoLift/blog/geo-measurement-review"}},"content":"## GeoLift v2.3 Release\\n\\n### TL;DR\\n- The new version of the GeoLift code makes the pre-test analysis (Power Analysis and Market Selection) easier than ever before! The entire process is now handled by a single function: `GeoLiftMarketSelection()`.\\n- The new package contains dozens of new features, functionalities, and bug fixes.\\n- A new and improved walkthrough guide is available to help internal and external users run their GeoLift tests from start to finish!\\n\\n## GeoLift v2.3: Power Calculations Made Easier\\nFollowing the feedback we received, we re-built the Power Calculation and Market Selection functionalities from the ground up! The new code makes this process easier, more streamlined, and more powerful than ever before.\\n\\n### What\'s New?\\n- We\'ve **streamlined the entire Power Analysis and Market Selection process into a single function**: `GeoLiftMarketSelection()`.\\n- Previously, the process to select the test markets was very convoluted and involved going through several functions: `NumberLocations()`, `GeoLiftPower.search()`, `GeoLiftPowerFinder()`, and `GeoLiftPower()`. The new function, `GeoLiftMarketSelection()`, aggregates all of their functionalities and even improves upon them.\\n- We\'re soft-deprecating the `NumberLocations()`, `GeoLiftPower.search()`, `GeoLiftPowerFinder()`, and `GeoLiftPower()`. The development of these functions is now considered complete and they\'re now superseeded by `GeoLiftMarketSelection()`.\\n- We\'ve included **two** new important **metrics** that can help us make better decisions when comparing between different test market candidates: _Average_MDE_ and _abs_lift_in_zero_.\\n- A **new and improved ranking system** takes into consideration all key model performance metrics to identify the best test markets for a given set-up.\\n- We\'ve added the option for **one tailed tests**.  These make the GeoLift model much more powerful than it was before, by simply changing the test hypothesis we want to validate.  Now you can chose from _Positive_, _Negative_ and _Total_ tests in the inference section and one sided or two sided tests in the power section.\\n- The Market Selection process is more flexible and customizable than before! You can now include **additional test constraints** to focus only on the tests that make sense for our client. These are: the available budget (_budget_), acceptable holdout ranges (_holdout_), test markets we want to force into the test regions (_include_markets_), and markets that shouldn\'t be considered as eligible test regions (_exclude_markets_).\\n- We\'ve added a **new plotting method for GeoLiftMarketSelection** objects. Through this method you can easily plot different test market selections and compare their model fit, MDE, and power curves! Plus, they lines have the GeoLift colors!\\n![PlotATTBest](/img/GeoLiftMarketSelection_Plot2-1.png)\\n- The **new function**: `GetWeights()` makes it easy to save the synthetic control weights into a data frame for further analysis.\\n- To aid with **MMM calibrations**, we\'ve included a new parameter in the Market Selection/Power Analysis function: _Correlations_. Setting it to TRUE allows the user to analyze the similarities between test and the control regions.\\n- You can also **plot historical similarities between test and control regions** with `plotCorrels()`.\\n![PlotATTBest](/img/plotcorrels.png)\\n- A revamped **GeoLift walkthrough vignette has been launched** to accompany the new version of the package. This new material provides much more detailed explanation on our model, it\'s parameters, how to run a study, and how to interpret the results.\\n- We\'ve **fixed multiple bug and errors** across the package (thanks for the feedback!).\\n- Thanks to all of these changes, we\'ve **significantly reduced the total time needed in pre-test calculations!**"},{"id":"geo-measurement-review","metadata":{"permalink":"/GeoLift/blog/geo-measurement-review","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/blog/2021-10-02-GeoMeasurement.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-10-02-GeoMeasurement.md","title":"A Brief Review of Geo Measurement Approaches","description":"Intro to Quasi-Experiments","date":"2021-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 2, 2021","tags":[{"label":"GeoLift","permalink":"/GeoLift/blog/tags/geo-lift"},{"label":"Geo Measurement","permalink":"/GeoLift/blog/tags/geo-measurement"},{"label":"SCM","permalink":"/GeoLift/blog/tags/scm"},{"label":"DID","permalink":"/GeoLift/blog/tags/did"}],"readingTime":1.68,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Arturo Esquerra","title":"Marketing Science @ Meta | GeoLift Team","url":"https://github.com/ArturoEsquerra/","imageURL":"https://github.com/ArturoEsquerra.png","key":"arturo"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"geo-measurement-review","title":"A Brief Review of Geo Measurement Approaches","authors":["arturo"],"tags":["GeoLift","Geo Measurement","SCM","DID"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Launching GeoLift v2.3 - Streamlined and Improved Power Calculations","permalink":"/GeoLift/blog/geolift-v23"},"nextItem":{"title":"Welcome","permalink":"/GeoLift/blog/welcome"}},"content":"## Intro to Quasi-Experiments\\nWhile Randomized Control Trials remain as the gold-standard for causal analysis, good RCTs are hard to come by given how complicated and expensive they are to execute. In particular, their reliance on randomization, which is the foundation for their unbiasedness, is often one of the factors that limit their usage. Some of the most common drawbacks of randomly splitting a population into test and control groups are:\\n\\n- Implementing and maintaining the randomization throughout the experiment requires a robust infrastructure.\\n- Limiting the treatment to only the test group can be unethical. For example, restraining the control group from receiving life-saving medicine is wrong. This could also be the case for PSAs.\\n- It is common to have constraints on which units can be part of the test and control groups. These constraints prevent us from having a good randomization. For example, in a geo-experiment there are often a set of locations that need to receive the treatment and some units can\u2019t get the treatment, which severely reduces the possible randomizations and greatly reduces the experiment\u2019s precision.\\n\\nQuasi-experimental methods offer a great alternative to measure the impact of a treatment (such as an ad campaign) whenever randomization is not logistically feasible or ethical. These methods differ from traditional RCTs in that they don\u2019t use randomization to select the test and control groups. This gives us a lot of additional flexibility in the experimental design at the cost of a typically larger sample sizes and additional modeling assumptions. Nevertheless, under the right circumstances quasi-experiments provide a great alternative to measure a treatment and can empower advertisers that have been historically unable to use incrementality to start taking decisions based on Lift. Moreover, one of the most commonly used type of quasi-experiments are geo tests, in which the units of experimentation are geographical areas such as zip-codes, cities, regions, or states. In this note we will do a historical review of the most commonly used approaches to geographic quasi-experimentation and compare them to GeoLift."},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/GeoLift/blog/welcome","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/blog/2021-10-01-welcome/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-10-01-welcome/index.md","title":"Welcome","description":"Welcome to GeoLift\'s blog where we discuss anything related to:","date":"2021-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 1, 2021","tags":[{"label":"facebook","permalink":"/GeoLift/blog/tags/facebook"},{"label":"hello","permalink":"/GeoLift/blog/tags/hello"},{"label":"GeoLift","permalink":"/GeoLift/blog/tags/geo-lift"}],"readingTime":0.105,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Arturo Esquerra","title":"Marketing Science @ Meta | GeoLift Team","url":"https://github.com/ArturoEsquerra/","imageURL":"https://github.com/ArturoEsquerra.png","key":"arturo"},{"name":"Nicolas Cruces","title":"Marketing Science @ Meta | GeoLift Team","url":"https://github.com/NicolasMatrices-v2","imageURL":"https://github.com/NicolasMatrices-v2.png","key":"nicolas"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"welcome","title":"Welcome","authors":["arturo","nicolas"],"tags":["facebook","hello","GeoLift"]},"prevItem":{"title":"A Brief Review of Geo Measurement Approaches","permalink":"/GeoLift/blog/geo-measurement-review"}},"content":"**Welcome to GeoLift\'s blog** where we discuss anything related to:\\n- Geo-testing\\n- Incrementality and Lift\\n- GeoLift\\n- and more!"}]}')}}]);
