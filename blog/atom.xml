<em><div align="right"> - Luis Alberto Spinetta</div></em><p></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tldr">TL;DR<a class="hash-link" href="#tldr" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ul><li>The success of a geo-based experiment greatly depends on the Market Selection process.</li><li>In the GeoLift package, we use historical data and a simulation-based approach to identify the best set of treatment and control locations based on the constraints specified by the user.</li><li>Selecting an appropriate value for the <code>lookback_window</code> parameter (the amount of pre-treatment periods that will be considered) is a very important part of the process.</li><li>Based on the analysis presented in this note, we generally recommend using <strong>1/10th of the pre-treatment period as a simulation <code>lookback_window</code></strong> (especially if your time-series has a lot of variability across time).</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-considered-a-simulation-in-geolift">What is considered a simulation in GeoLift?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-considered-a-simulation-in-geolift" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Essentially, before running the actual test, we are running a series of geo experiments to determine which is the best setup that will pave the way to success. As explained in further detail in <a href="https://www.facebookblueprint.com/student/path/253063" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Blueprint Course</a>, the GeoLift Market Selection process simulates a large number of geo experiments to determine which is the best test and control setup for you.</p><p>In each simulation a <strong>treatment effect</strong> is applied over a <strong>treatment group</strong> during the <strong>treatment period</strong>. Then, GeoLift then trains a <strong>counterfactual</strong> for the treatment group by using all of <strong>the pre-treatment periods</strong> prior to the experiment to assess the model's performance.  Let’s breakdown each of these five components:</p><ul><li><strong>The treatment effect</strong>: is the Lift percentage that will be applied to a set of locations during the testing period.</li><li><strong>The treatment group</strong>: these are a set of locations that will be exposed to the treatment effect.</li><li><strong>The counterfactual</strong>: these are a set of locations that are used to estimate what would have happened to the treatment group if it had not been exposed to the treatment effect.  An easy way to think about it is as a weighted average of all the locations that are not part of the treatment group.</li><li><strong>The treatment period</strong>: represents the moments in which the treatment group will be exposed to the treatment.</li><li><strong>The pre-treatment period</strong>: this refers to the amount of periods that will be used to build the counterfactual, where there was no simulated difference between locations.  During this period, the counterfactual and the treatment group should have a similar behavior.</li></ul><p>Applying different effects to the same group in the same period allows us to holistically determine what the Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE) for that setup will be.  Among other metrics, this helps us understand whether we are dealing with a combination of locations that will have a higher likelihood of observing small effect sizes. However, seasonalities and variations throughout time make can difficult to estimate the MDE with complete certainty.  Fortunately, we can reduce this uncertainty by taking a look at the past!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introducing-the-lookback-window-parameter">Introducing the lookback window parameter.<a class="hash-link" href="#introducing-the-lookback-window-parameter" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Our first simulation uses the most recent/latest periods in our series as our <strong>treatment period</strong> and all of the remaining periods as our <strong>pre-treatment period</strong>.  This gives us the metrics we need to rank treatment groups for those time periods.</p><p>As stated in our <a href="https://facebookincubator.github.io/GeoLift/docs/GettingStarted/Walkthrough" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GeoLift Walkthrough</a>, we can increase the number of simulated time periods by changing the <code>lookback_window</code>.  The <code>lookback_window</code> indicates how far back in time the simulations for the power analysis will go.  By increasing the <code>lookback_window</code>, we subtract the last period from the previous simulation’s total duration and repeat the process over the remaining periods.  Finally, we calculate the average metrics for each treatment group over all of the runs in different periods.</p><p>For example, imagine we have a 90 day long series with different locations and we would like to simulate a 15 day test, with a 2 day <code>lookback_window</code>.</p><ul><li>In the first simulation, the <strong>treatment period</strong> is made up of the most recent dates and Lift is simulated on it.  The remainder, the <strong>pre-treatment period</strong>, is used to build a counterfactual.  So, with a test duration of 15 days, for this iteration we use periods 1 to 75 as a <strong>pre-treatment period</strong> and periods 76 to 90 as a <strong>treatment period</strong>.</li><li>For our second simulation, the treatment period is shifted by one timestamp.  We use periods 1 to 74 as a pre-treatment period and periods 75 to 89 as a <strong>treatment period</strong>.</li><li>We then construct average metrics per each <strong>treatment group</strong>, using these two simulations.  In essence, we are repeating this flow until the number of time periods shifted is equal to the <code>lookback_window</code> parameter.</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/blob/main/website/static/img/lookback_1.png?raw=true" alt="lookbackwindow" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In this context, more simulations allow us to have a more robust estimate of the metrics for each <strong>treatment group</strong>, observing if the same behavior occurs across different simulated <strong>treatment</strong> and <strong>pre-treatment periods</strong>.  The intuitive idea here is that we would like to capture some of the variability in the time series in our test setups, to avoid assuming something that could be different in the future.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="theres-a-tradeoff-robustness-vs-preciseness">There’s a tradeoff: robustness vs preciseness<a class="hash-link" href="#theres-a-tradeoff-robustness-vs-preciseness" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The more we look back into the past, the more simulations per <strong>treatment group</strong> we will have.  This will make our estimates more robust and allow us to make safer predictions with regard to the pre-test metrics.</p><p>However, the more we look back into the past, the less precise our simulation will be as compared to the actual result.  Removing the last periods we have prior to the test leads to two major effects:</p><ul><li>Our simulations become less precise because they have a smaller amount of periods to build the counterfactual than what the actual experiment will have.</li><li>The accuracy of our simulation will be reduced since we are shortening the time that is being considered by the algorithm’s pre-treatment period.</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/blob/main/website/static/img/lookback_2.png?raw=true" alt="lookback_tradeoff" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Given this tradeoff, we need to choose the amount of simulations we run considering the potential they have but keeping in mind that they also have a downside. Moreover, it is important to note that incresing the <code>lookback_window</code> parameter will exponentially increase the number of simulations performed in the Market Selection algorithm and will result in a longer runtime.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-to-choose-the-best-lookback_window">How to choose the best <code>lookback_window</code>?<a class="hash-link" href="#how-to-choose-the-best-lookback_window" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The best way to analyze this problem is to capture the variance of detected effects in the same simulated <strong>treatment period</strong> for different <strong>treatment group</strong> combinations.</p><p>We have run this analysis using the dummy dataset that is available within the GeoLift package (<code>data(GeoLift_PreTest)</code>).  This dataset is similar to the example we showed above: it has a total of 90 days of pre-experiment data, and we will simulate a test that will last 15 days.  If we assume that there was no preexisting difference between locations, then the median of detected effects for each test start period should be around zero, which is the true effect.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/blob/main/website/static/img/lookback_3.png?raw=true" alt="Simulations_lookback" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><em>The plot on the left shows the standard deviation of the detected effect per treatment start period. The plot on the right shows the range of detected effects for different treatment groups.</em></p><p>As we can see from the plot in the left, the standard deviation of the detected effect has a continuous drop from period 67 onwards.  From the second plot, we can also observe that the median effect is close to zero, especially in the last periods.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="putting-it-in-practice">Putting it in practice<a class="hash-link" href="#putting-it-in-practice" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Since we have 75 pre-treatment periods in total, and the drop in standard deviation occurs in period 67, we would set a <code>lookback_window</code> of 8 periods.</p><p>To be as efficient as possible, we suggest running the GeoLiftMarketSelection function to find the best combination of markets with a <code>lookback_window=1</code>.  With those best candidates, do a deep dive with a longer <code>lookback_window=8</code> for each treatment combination by running GeoLiftPower, plot and analyze their power curves.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="in-conclusion">In conclusion<a class="hash-link" href="#in-conclusion" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The <code>lookback_window</code> parameter is a fundamental element of a robust Power Analysis and Market Selection. As a best practice, we recommend running a data-driven analysis similar to the one that was showcased here to identify the ideal value for this parameter. Alternatively, <strong>a great rule of thumb is to keep 1/10 of the pre-treatment periods for simulations, once the test duration has been defined</strong>. So, if you have a total of 150 periods before your experiment, and you want to run a 10 day test, a total of 140 pre-treatment periods would remain.  Following this rule, you would have to set a <code>lookback_window=14</code> for the preferred options that come out of the GeoLiftMarketSelection ranking.</p><p>At the very least,  we suggest setting the <code>lookback_window</code> to a value that is at least as large as the time-series’ most granular seasonality (if we observe that sales vary widely throughout the days of the week, then setting the <code>lookback_window</code> to 7 would be a good start).</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-up-next">What’s up next?<a class="hash-link" href="#whats-up-next" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Stay tuned for our next blog posts, related to topics like:</p><ul><li>When should I use Fixed Effects to get a higher signal to noise ratio?</li><li>When should our GeoLift test start?</li></ul>]]></content>

However, advertising effects are rarely instantaneous.  Certain actions have longer conversion cycles and will require continued monitoring after campaigns complete to assess their impacts in full.  We explore the usage of post test conversion windows to measure these lagged effects and some of the considerations advertisers should take when thinking about using them.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-a-post-test-conversion-window-and-why-do-we-use-them">What is a post test conversion window and why do we use them?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-a-post-test-conversion-window-and-why-do-we-use-them" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>A post test conversion window is an interval of time after the completion of an experiment where we continue to track conversions to account for delayed impacts of our advertising efforts.  If the time it takes for our customers to take a desired action significantly lags when they view our advertisement, we can append this window and monitor our desired event after the experiment concludes.</p><p>Post test conversion windows can also be used as a cooldown period between testing different strategies.  They help us run cleaner experiments knowing we are closer to steady-state performance without the lagged effects of other campaigns.</p><blockquote><p>Jasper’s Market, a fictional retailer, needed to understand the value of their upcoming marketing campaign.  They plan on running a month-long campaign and know they have a typical purchase cycle of three weeks.  In other words, it takes their customers an average of three weeks from when they see an advertisement to physically going to the store and making a purchase.  Jasper’s Market felt that they would not be able to fully capture the impact of their marketing efforts by just measuring when their campaign is live, so they decided to append a post test conversion window to their experiment to measure the delayed effects of their campaign.</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="when-should-we-include-a-post-test-conversion-window">When should we include a post test conversion window?<a class="hash-link" href="#when-should-we-include-a-post-test-conversion-window" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>When deciding to include a post test conversion window, we are balancing two different forces.  On one hand we want to incorporate the lagged effects of our advertising efforts, better representing the complete impact of the campaign, while simultaneously trying to avoid introducing noise into the experimental analysis and potentially diluting the impact of our campaign.</p><p>To balance this in our favor, it makes sense to incorporate a post test conversion window when the marketing campaign effects we are measuring occur well after the advertisement is delivered.  The shorter the duration of the campaign relative to the time it typically takes for the conversion to occur (purchase cycle) the more likely we will benefit from including this window.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-do-we-determine-the-optimal-length">How do we determine the optimal length?<a class="hash-link" href="#how-do-we-determine-the-optimal-length" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>We can start by fixing the post test conversion window to the duration of our typical purchase cycle.  We can then measure the daily incremental conversion volume or average treatment effect on treated (ATT) over both the test period and the post test conversion window to determine the incremental impact of the test.</p><p>To determine the optimal duration for future tests, we can take note of how long it takes for test and control geographies to reconverge after the campaign treatment ends and set that as the duration going forward.  In some instances, the test and control populations might not reconverge exactly.  For these cases, we could determine a ‘Region of Practical Equivalence’ (ROPE) for the ATT and if the discrepancy falls within that range, we can change the post test conversion duration.  If the discrepancy is large however, we should inspect the individual geographies and ensure no unusual events occurred within any of the test or control locations and possibly repeat the experiment before assuming the effect goes into perpetuity.</p><blockquote><p>Jasper’s Market decided to launch their geo-experiment with a post conversion window of three weeks.  By doing this they ensure they will capture the lagged effects of their marketing efforts.  After the experiment ended, they continued monitoring their ATT.  As they had suspected, the gap between test and control did not immediately close after the experiment but continued for an additional two weeks before reconverging back to a negligible level.   Had they stopped monitoring the results after the end of the campaign they would have fully captured the impact of their efforts.  Having the post conversion window also helped them identify the amount of time needed after the campaign ended to run their next experiment without the fear of contamination.</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="viewing-post-test-conversion-windows-in-geolift">Viewing Post Test Conversion Windows in GeoLift<a class="hash-link" href="#viewing-post-test-conversion-windows-in-geolift" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>We recently added a small change to version 2.4.32, which allows the user to input the number of periods included as a post test conversion window.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR:]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tldr">TL;DR:<a class="hash-link" href="#tldr" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ul><li>Inverse GeoLifts help advertisers reduce geo experiment holdout sizes by inverting who sees ads: they show ads to the control group and do not show ads to the treatment group.</li><li>Given that geo-experiments require large control groups, Inverse GeoLifts are a good way of reducing holdout groups and opportunity cost without losing testing accuracy.</li><li>While Standard GeoLifts are great tools to measure a new media activity, ongoing media is best tested with an Inverse GeoLift.</li><li>MMM calibration: Standard GeoLifts are straightforward inputs into MMMs, while Inverse GeoLifts have a larger complexity for this use case.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introduction-and-motivation">Introduction and motivation<a class="hash-link" href="#introduction-and-motivation" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>GeoLift is an end-to-end solution that empowers you to determine the real effect of media via geographical experiments.</p><ul><li><strong>It’s causal.</strong>  GeoLift follows the KPI of a treatment group and compares it to what would have happened to that treatment group, if they had not been treated.  This is what we call a counterfactual.  The latter is built off of control locations that will not be exposed to the treatment effect and paired as close as possible to the treatment group, prior to the test.</li><li><strong>It’s transparent.</strong>  Being an open source package <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hosted on Github</a>, the code is freely available for everyone to use and inspect.</li><li><strong>It sets you up for success.</strong>  There are many packages that help you analyze geographical quasi-experiments.  There’s only one that runs power analysis via simulations to help the user define where the treatment should be applied, on top of the standard analysis module.</li><li>It’s based on <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.2021.1929245" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cutting-edge econometric models</a>.</li></ul><p>In order to construct a robust counterfactual, GeoLift usually requires more than half the amount of available locations to be part of the control group.  This is because the counterfactual is created as a linear combination of the units in the pool of controls, therefore, richer pools tend to provide more robust counterfactuals.  Standard GeoLifts can be a great setup when you are trying to measure the positive effect that new media has on your business.</p><p>However, <strong>it can be detrimental to run an experiment with a large holdout when you would like to measure ongoing media efforts</strong>.  This has to do with the opportunity cost of running a test.  When you are holding out media from certain locations, your total KPI will decrease by the effect that media has in those locations, scaled by the size of the holdout.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/blob/main/website/static/img/OppCost.png?raw=true" alt="OppCost" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-new-hope">A new hope<a class="hash-link" href="#a-new-hope" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>A great way to reduce holdout size without compromising experiment accuracy is to <strong>flip GeoLift on its head</strong>: instead of showing media to the treatment group and holding out the control group, you holdout the treatment group and show media to the control group.  This is what we refer to as an Inverse GeoLift.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/blob/main/website/static/img/InverseLiftTable.png?raw=true" alt="InverseTable" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Inverse GeoLifts have a different interpretation than Standard GeoLifts.  Instead of measuring the contribution that media is having on the treatment locations, you are measuring the opportunity cost that holding out media has on the treatment locations.</p><p>The main assumption here is that positive and negative effects are interchangeable.  In other words, if you would run a Standard or an Inverse GeoLift, the only thing that would change is the sign of the effect, not its absolute value.  <strong>Don’t worry</strong>: when setting up a GeoLift and deciding which is the best treatment group for the experiment, the difference between the detected effect and the true effect is a variable that we are taking into account to rank different location combinations. Treatment setups that have a low difference are preferred and will be highly ranked.  <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/blob/main/vignettes/GeoLift_Walkthrough.md#power-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check here</a> to see what the ranking variables look like in our Walkthrough.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/blob/main/website/static/img/TypesGeoLift.png?raw=true" alt="TypesGeoLift" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tips-for-building-and-analyzing-an-inverse-geolift">Tips for building and analyzing an Inverse GeoLift<a class="hash-link" href="#tips-for-building-and-analyzing-an-inverse-geolift" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="determine-budget-for-the-test">Determine budget for the test.<a class="hash-link" href="#determine-budget-for-the-test" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>As long as you know your Cost Per Incremental Conversion (CPIC), Standard GeoLifts will tell you the minimum budget that you should invest in the treatment group.  For Inverse GeoLifts, we have to interpret the budget suggestion as the minimum amount of money that should be taken away from the treatment group.  You can see these values in the <code>Investment</code> column from the output of <code>GeoLiftMarketSelection</code>.</p><p>If your treatment group is currently investing less than the required budget, then it will be hard to detect an effect, given that the CPIC is accurate.  You should try to select treatment setups that have a current investment that is below the absolute value of the required budget.  If there are no feasible options,  we suggest increasing the budget for all markets within the control group to ensure that the minimum amount of investment in the treatment group is met.  While this could change Business As Usual media circumstances, it becomes necessary in order to run a well-powered experiment. A good ad hoc rule for these cases is to compute the extra budget needed by calculating the difference between the required budget and the current investment in treatment and scaling that by the treatment investment share over total investment.  This will give you the value that you need to put up to run a successful experiment.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/blob/main/website/static/img/ExtraInvestment.png?raw=true" alt="ExtraInvestment" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="keep-an-eye-on-the-weights-for-the-counterfactual">Keep an eye on the weights for the counterfactual.<a class="hash-link" href="#keep-an-eye-on-the-weights-for-the-counterfactual" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>When setting up the test, you can access the weights for each of the control locations with the <code>GetWeights()</code> method.  This will show you how each of the locations that will not be treated (shown media ads) will be weighted within the counterfactual.</p><p>When running an Inverse GeoLift, it’s important to guarantee that you will show media ads in these locations.  If available, you can validate this by getting an investment report by location and ensuring that all locations with a positive weight in the counterfactual from GeoLift are being shown ads.  If this condition is not met, we could be observing a very small treatment effect due to dilution of media within the control group, when the real treatment effect could be large.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="look-for-symmetric-power-curves">Look for symmetric power curves<a class="hash-link" href="#look-for-symmetric-power-curves" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A symmetric power curve with respect to the y axis will guarantee that there are no considerable differences for a particular setup when changing from a Standard to an Inverse GeoLift.  This is another guarantee that our assumptions for these types of tests hold.  You can visualize this by running the <code>GeoLiftPower()</code> function with positive and negative effects, a larger <code>lookback_window</code> and plotting its output.  You can check for examples of what it should look like in our Github Walkthrough.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="calculate-the-treatments-cpic">Calculate the Treatment’s CPIC<a class="hash-link" href="#calculate-the-treatments-cpic" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>At the end of your experiment, you will want to know how much each incremental action in the treatment group cost.  Since you did not invest in the treatment, you need to estimate the budget in that group.  In order to do so, you can calculate the sum of GeoLift weights from the counterfactual and multiply them by the investment per location in the control.  Dividing it by the incremental conversions will give you the Cost Per Incremental Conversion.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/blob/main/website/static/img/CPICEquation.png?raw=true" alt="CPIC" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Where t0 represents the last pre-treatment time-stamp, T represents the treatment end, and N represents the number of units in the pool of controls.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-up-next">What’s up next?<a class="hash-link" href="#whats-up-next" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Stay tuned for our next blog posts, related to topics like:</p><ul><li>Calibrating your MMM model with GeoLift.</li><li>What should my lookback window be?</li><li>When should our GeoLift test start?</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="want-to-try-out-your-first-inverse-geolift">Want to try out your first Inverse GeoLift?<a class="hash-link" href="#want-to-try-out-your-first-inverse-geolift" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Install our Github package by <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift#installing-geolift" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">following this link</a>, or join our Facebook Group if you have further questions on our open source tool!</p>]]></content>

In particular, their reliance on randomization, which is the foundation for their unbiasedness, is often one of the factors that limit their usage. Some of the most common drawbacks of randomly splitting a population into test and control groups are:</p><ul><li>Implementing and maintaining the randomization throughout the experiment requires a robust infrastructure.</li><li>Limiting the treatment to only the test group can be unethical. For example, restraining the control group from receiving life-saving medicine is wrong. This could also be the case for PSAs.</li><li>It is common to have constraints on which units can be part of the test and control groups. These constraints prevent us from having a good randomization. For example, in a geo-experiment there are often a set of locations that need to receive the treatment and some units can’t get the treatment, which severely reduces the possible randomizations and greatly reduces the experiment’s precision.</li></ul><p>Quasi-experimental methods offer a great alternative to measure the impact of a treatment (such as an ad campaign) whenever randomization is not logistically feasible or ethical. These methods differ from traditional RCTs in that they don’t use randomization to select the test and control groups. This gives us a lot of additional flexibility in the experimental design at the cost of a typically larger sample sizes and additional modeling assumptions. Nevertheless, under the right circumstances quasi-experiments provide a great alternative to measure a treatment and can empower advertisers that have been historically unable to use incrementality to start taking decisions based on Lift. Moreover, one of the most commonly used type of quasi-experiments are geo tests, in which the units of experimentation are geographical areas such as zip-codes, cities, regions, or states. In this note we will do a historical review of the most commonly used approaches to geographic quasi-experimentation and compare them to GeoLift.</p>]]></content>
