            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introduction">Introduction<a class="hash-link" href="#introduction" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Today we released a <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/tree/GeoLiftPython" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tutorial</a> explaining how to run an end-to-end implementation of GeoLift in Python leveraging the <code>rpy2</code> package.  This has been a frequently requested feature by the GeoLift community. Moreover, it is one that we believe is very important for the continued scaling of GeoLift in data-savvy organizations.</p><p>The goal of this tutorial is to empower Python users to run the GeoLift R functions in Python using the <a href="https://rpy2.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>rpy2</code></a> package. The rpy2 is an open source library which enables calling R from Python. It’s designed to facilitate the use of R by Python programmers.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="geolift-in-python">GeoLift in Python<a class="hash-link" href="#geolift-in-python" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>GeoLift is an end-to-end solution to measure Lift at a Geo-level using the latest developments in Synthetic Control Methods. Through this tutorial it is possible to run GeoLift R functions such as: Power Calculations, Inference, and Plots in Python.</p><p>There are 3 functions in Python under utils.py:</p><ul><li><p><code>GeoLiftData</code>: Load and return the dataset included in the GeoLift package.</p></li><li><p><code>ConvertDf</code>: Convert R dataframe into Pandas if <code>conv_type = "ToPandas"</code> or convert Pandas dataframe into R if <code>conv_type = "ToR"</code>.</p></li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/blob/main/website/static/img/GeoLiftPython_1.jpg?raw=true" alt="ConvertDf" class="img_ev3q"></p><ul><li><code>GeoLiftPlot</code>: Receive a specific GeoLift Plot function (defined by the <code>func</code> parameter), its arguments and display the plot.</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/blob/main/website/static/img/GeoLiftPython_2.jpg?raw=true" alt="GeoLiftPlot" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>To run the R GeoLift functions in Python, you need to add <code>GeoLift.</code> in front of it as in <code>GeoLift.GeoLiftMarketSelection()</code>. For example:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/blob/main/website/static/img/GeoLiftPython_3.jpg?raw=true" alt="GeoLiftPython" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="start-your-geolift-in-python-now">Start Your GeoLift in Python Now!​<a class="hash-link" href="#start-your-geolift-in-python-now" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>You can access the GeoLift in Python tutorial in the GeoLiftPython folder hosted in the GeoLift github repository through <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/tree/GeoLiftPython" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this link</a>. The <code>README</code> file contains all the necessary information to start working with the Python version of GeoLift.</p>]]></content:encoded>

However, advertising effects are rarely instantaneous.  Certain actions have longer conversion cycles and will require continued monitoring after campaigns complete to assess their impacts in full.  We explore the usage of post test conversion windows to measure these lagged effects and some of the considerations advertisers should take when thinking about using them.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-a-post-test-conversion-window-and-why-do-we-use-them">What is a post test conversion window and why do we use them?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-a-post-test-conversion-window-and-why-do-we-use-them" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>A post test conversion window is an interval of time after the completion of an experiment where we continue to track conversions to account for delayed impacts of our advertising efforts.  If the time it takes for our customers to take a desired action significantly lags when they view our advertisement, we can append this window and monitor our desired event after the experiment concludes.</p><p>Post test conversion windows can also be used as a cooldown period between testing different strategies.  They help us run cleaner experiments knowing we are closer to steady-state performance without the lagged effects of other campaigns.</p><blockquote><p>Jasper’s Market, a fictional retailer, needed to understand the value of their upcoming marketing campaign.  They plan on running a month-long campaign and know they have a typical purchase cycle of three weeks.  In other words, it takes their customers an average of three weeks from when they see an advertisement to physically going to the store and making a purchase.  Jasper’s Market felt that they would not be able to fully capture the impact of their marketing efforts by just measuring when their campaign is live, so they decided to append a post test conversion window to their experiment to measure the delayed effects of their campaign.</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="when-should-we-include-a-post-test-conversion-window">When should we include a post test conversion window?<a class="hash-link" href="#when-should-we-include-a-post-test-conversion-window" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>When deciding to include a post test conversion window, we are balancing two different forces.  On one hand we want to incorporate the lagged effects of our advertising efforts, better representing the complete impact of the campaign, while simultaneously trying to avoid introducing noise into the experimental analysis and potentially diluting the impact of our campaign.</p><p>To balance this in our favor, it makes sense to incorporate a post test conversion window when the marketing campaign effects we are measuring occur well after the advertisement is delivered.  The shorter the duration of the campaign relative to the time it typically takes for the conversion to occur (purchase cycle) the more likely we will benefit from including this window.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-do-we-determine-the-optimal-length">How do we determine the optimal length?<a class="hash-link" href="#how-do-we-determine-the-optimal-length" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>We can start by fixing the post test conversion window to the duration of our typical purchase cycle.  We can then measure the daily incremental conversion volume or average treatment effect on treated (ATT) over both the test period and the post test conversion window to determine the incremental impact of the test.</p><p>To determine the optimal duration for future tests, we can take note of how long it takes for test and control geographies to reconverge after the campaign treatment ends and set that as the duration going forward.  In some instances, the test and control populations might not reconverge exactly.  For these cases, we could determine a ‘Region of Practical Equivalence’ (ROPE) for the ATT and if the discrepancy falls within that range, we can change the post test conversion duration.  If the discrepancy is large however, we should inspect the individual geographies and ensure no unusual events occurred within any of the test or control locations and possibly repeat the experiment before assuming the effect goes into perpetuity.</p><blockquote><p>Jasper’s Market decided to launch their geo-experiment with a post conversion window of three weeks.  By doing this they ensure they will capture the lagged effects of their marketing efforts.  After the experiment ended, they continued monitoring their ATT.  As they had suspected, the gap between test and control did not immediately close after the experiment but continued for an additional two weeks before reconverging back to a negligible level.   Had they stopped monitoring the results after the end of the campaign they would have fully captured the impact of their efforts.  Having the post conversion window also helped them identify the amount of time needed after the campaign ended to run their next experiment without the fear of contamination.</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="viewing-post-test-conversion-windows-in-geolift">Viewing Post Test Conversion Windows in GeoLift<a class="hash-link" href="#viewing-post-test-conversion-windows-in-geolift" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>We recently added a small change to version 2.4.32, which allows the user to input the number of periods included as a post test conversion window.   This update has been added to both the absolute Lift and the ATT plots.
Within Lift you can include a ‘post_test_treatment_periods’ which will allow you to view the Treatment and Post Treatment periods in different colors.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/blob/main/website/static/img/LaggedEffects_Lift.png?raw=true" alt="LaggedEffectsLift" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Additionally in the ATT plot you can also include the ‘post_test_treatment_periods’ and a ROPE = TRUE parameter which will delineate the post_treatment window and show you the region of practical equivalence defined as between 10% and 90% quantiles for the ATT prior to the experiment.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/blob/main/website/static/img/LaggedEffects_ATT.png?raw=true" alt="LaggedEffectsLift" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts<a class="hash-link" href="#final-thoughts" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>When measuring the impact of your next advertising campaign, consider adding a post test conversion window to capture the lagged effects of your marketing efforts. The longer the purchase cycle for your product the more crucial it is that you incorporate one in your analysis. In addition to helping with measurement the cooldown period will also ensure you are ready to launch your next experiment on a blank slate without contamination of your prior campaign.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-up-next">What’s up next?<a class="hash-link" href="#whats-up-next" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Stay tuned for our next blog posts, related to topics like:</p><ul><li>Calibrating your MMM model with GeoLift.</li><li>When should I use Fixed Effects to get a higher signal to noise ratio?</li><li>When should our GeoLift test start?</li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

This is because the counterfactual is created as a linear combination of the units in the pool of controls, therefore, richer pools tend to provide more robust counterfactuals.  Standard GeoLifts can be a great setup when you are trying to measure the positive effect that new media has on your business.</p><p>However, <strong>it can be detrimental to run an experiment with a large holdout when you would like to measure ongoing media efforts</strong>.  This has to do with the opportunity cost of running a test.  When you are holding out media from certain locations, your total KPI will decrease by the effect that media has in those locations, scaled by the size of the holdout.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/blob/main/website/static/img/OppCost.png?raw=true" alt="OppCost" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-new-hope">A new hope<a class="hash-link" href="#a-new-hope" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>A great way to reduce holdout size without compromising experiment accuracy is to <strong>flip GeoLift on its head</strong>: instead of showing media to the treatment group and holding out the control group, you holdout the treatment group and show media to the control group.  This is what we refer to as an Inverse GeoLift.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/blob/main/website/static/img/InverseLiftTable.png?raw=true" alt="InverseTable" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Inverse GeoLifts have a different interpretation than Standard GeoLifts.  Instead of measuring the contribution that media is having on the treatment locations, you are measuring the opportunity cost that holding out media has on the treatment locations.</p><p>The main assumption here is that positive and negative effects are interchangeable.  In other words, if you would run a Standard or an Inverse GeoLift, the only thing that would change is the sign of the effect, not its absolute value.  <strong>Don’t worry</strong>: when setting up a GeoLift and deciding which is the best treatment group for the experiment, the difference between the detected effect and the true effect is a variable that we are taking into account to rank different location combinations. Treatment setups that have a low difference are preferred and will be highly ranked.  <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/blob/main/vignettes/GeoLift_Walkthrough.md#power-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check here</a> to see what the ranking variables look like in our Walkthrough.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/blob/main/website/static/img/TypesGeoLift.png?raw=true" alt="TypesGeoLift" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tips-for-building-and-analyzing-an-inverse-geolift">Tips for building and analyzing an Inverse GeoLift<a class="hash-link" href="#tips-for-building-and-analyzing-an-inverse-geolift" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="determine-budget-for-the-test">Determine budget for the test.<a class="hash-link" href="#determine-budget-for-the-test" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>As long as you know your Cost Per Incremental Conversion (CPIC), Standard GeoLifts will tell you the minimum budget that you should invest in the treatment group.  For Inverse GeoLifts, we have to interpret the budget suggestion as the minimum amount of money that should be taken away from the treatment group.  You can see these values in the <code>Investment</code> column from the output of <code>GeoLiftMarketSelection</code>.</p><p>If your treatment group is currently investing less than the required budget, then it will be hard to detect an effect, given that the CPIC is accurate.  You should try to select treatment setups that have a current investment that is below the absolute value of the required budget.  If there are no feasible options,  we suggest increasing the budget for all markets within the control group to ensure that the minimum amount of investment in the treatment group is met.  While this could change Business As Usual media circumstances, it becomes necessary in order to run a well-powered experiment. A good ad hoc rule for these cases is to compute the extra budget needed by calculating the difference between the required budget and the current investment in treatment and scaling that by the treatment investment share over total investment.  This will give you the value that you need to put up to run a successful experiment.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/blob/main/website/static/img/ExtraInvestment.png?raw=true" alt="ExtraInvestment" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="keep-an-eye-on-the-weights-for-the-counterfactual">Keep an eye on the weights for the counterfactual.<a class="hash-link" href="#keep-an-eye-on-the-weights-for-the-counterfactual" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>When setting up the test, you can access the weights for each of the control locations with the <code>GetWeights()</code> method.  This will show you how each of the locations that will not be treated (shown media ads) will be weighted within the counterfactual.</p><p>When running an Inverse GeoLift, it’s important to guarantee that you will show media ads in these locations.  If available, you can validate this by getting an investment report by location and ensuring that all locations with a positive weight in the counterfactual from GeoLift are being shown ads.  If this condition is not met, we could be observing a very small treatment effect due to dilution of media within the control group, when the real treatment effect could be large.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="look-for-symmetric-power-curves">Look for symmetric power curves<a class="hash-link" href="#look-for-symmetric-power-curves" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A symmetric power curve with respect to the y axis will guarantee that there are no considerable differences for a particular setup when changing from a Standard to an Inverse GeoLift.  This is another guarantee that our assumptions for these types of tests hold.  You can visualize this by running the <code>GeoLiftPower()</code> function with positive and negative effects, a larger <code>lookback_window</code> and plotting its output.  You can check for examples of what it should look like in our Github Walkthrough.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="calculate-the-treatments-cpic">Calculate the Treatment’s CPIC<a class="hash-link" href="#calculate-the-treatments-cpic" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>At the end of your experiment, you will want to know how much each incremental action in the treatment group cost.  Since you did not invest in the treatment, you need to estimate the budget in that group.  In order to do so, you can calculate the sum of GeoLift weights from the counterfactual and multiply them by the investment per location in the control.  Dividing it by the incremental conversions will give you the Cost Per Incremental Conversion.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift/blob/main/website/static/img/CPICEquation.png?raw=true" alt="CPIC" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Where t0 represents the last pre-treatment time-stamp, T represents the treatment end, and N represents the number of units in the pool of controls.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-up-next">What’s up next?<a class="hash-link" href="#whats-up-next" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Stay tuned for our next blog posts, related to topics like:</p><ul><li>Calibrating your MMM model with GeoLift.</li><li>What should my lookback window be?</li><li>When should our GeoLift test start?</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="want-to-try-out-your-first-inverse-geolift">Want to try out your first Inverse GeoLift?<a class="hash-link" href="#want-to-try-out-your-first-inverse-geolift" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Install our Github package by <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift#installing-geolift" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">following this link</a>, or join our Facebook Group if you have further questions on our open source tool!</p>]]></content:encoded>

You can now include <strong>additional test constraints</strong> to focus only on the tests that make sense for our client. These are: the available budget (<em>budget</em>), acceptable holdout ranges (<em>holdout</em>), test markets we want to force into the test regions (<em>include_markets</em>), and markets that shouldn't be considered as eligible test regions (<em>exclude_markets</em>).</li><li>We've added a <strong>new plotting method for GeoLiftMarketSelection</strong> objects. Through this method you can easily plot different test market selections and compare their model fit, MDE, and power curves! Plus, they lines have the GeoLift colors!

            <description><![CDATA[Intro to Quasi-Experiments]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="intro-to-quasi-experiments">Intro to Quasi-Experiments<a class="hash-link" href="#intro-to-quasi-experiments" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>While Randomized Control Trials remain as the gold-standard for causal analysis, good RCTs are hard to come by given how complicated and expensive they are to execute. In particular, their reliance on randomization, which is the foundation for their unbiasedness, is often one of the factors that limit their usage. Some of the most common drawbacks of randomly splitting a population into test and control groups are:</p><ul><li>Implementing and maintaining the randomization throughout the experiment requires a robust infrastructure.</li><li>Limiting the treatment to only the test group can be unethical. For example, restraining the control group from receiving life-saving medicine is wrong. This could also be the case for PSAs.</li><li>It is common to have constraints on which units can be part of the test and control groups. These constraints prevent us from having a good randomization. For example, in a geo-experiment there are often a set of locations that need to receive the treatment and some units can’t get the treatment, which severely reduces the possible randomizations and greatly reduces the experiment’s precision.</li></ul><p>Quasi-experimental methods offer a great alternative to measure the impact of a treatment (such as an ad campaign) whenever randomization is not logistically feasible or ethical. These methods differ from traditional RCTs in that they don’t use randomization to select the test and control groups. This gives us a lot of additional flexibility in the experimental design at the cost of a typically larger sample sizes and additional modeling assumptions. Nevertheless, under the right circumstances quasi-experiments provide a great alternative to measure a treatment and can empower advertisers that have been historically unable to use incrementality to start taking decisions based on Lift. Moreover, one of the most commonly used type of quasi-experiments are geo tests, in which the units of experimentation are geographical areas such as zip-codes, cities, regions, or states. In this note we will do a historical review of the most commonly used approaches to geographic quasi-experimentation and compare them to GeoLift.</p>]]></content:encoded>
