\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame containing the historical conversions by
geographic unit. It requires a "locations" column with the geo name,
a "Y" column with the outcome data (units), a time column with the indicator
of the time period (starting at 1), and covariates.}

\item{locations}{A semi-colon separated list of test geo locations.}

\item{effect_size}{A vector of effect sizes to test by default a
sequence between 0 - 100 percent in 5 percent increments: seq(0,1,0.05).}

\item{treatment_periods}{Expected length of the test. A vector of
possible lengths can be entered for multiple options.}

\item{horizon}{An integer that defines at which time-stamp the power simulations
will start. This parameter allows the user to define which period is most relevant
for the test's current in-market dynamics (a very small horizon will include
simulations of time periods with dynamics that might not be relevant anymore).
Ideally the horizon should encompass at least of couple of times the test length.
For instance, for a power analysis with 180 days of historical data and a 15 day
test, we would recommend setting horizon to at least 150. By default horizon is set
to -1 which will  execute the smallest possible horizon with the provided data.}

\item{cpic}{Cost Per Incremental Conversion for estimated test
minimum budget. The default value is 0, in which case no investment
estimation will be provided.}

\item{X}{List of names of covariates. No covariates are used
by default.}

\item{Y_id}{Name of the outcome variable. "Y" by default.}

\item{location_id}{Name of the location variable. "Y" by default.}

\item{time_id}{Name of the time variable. "Y" by default.}

\item{alpha}{Significance level. Set to 0.1 by default.}

\item{type}{Method of inference used in the analysis.
pValue=Provides conformal inference to provide the aggregate
p-value for the null hypothesis of no effect from the intervention.
The Default type is pValue.
Imbalance=Uses the model's Scaled L2 Imbalance metric.}

\item{normalize}{A logic flag indicating whether to scale the outcome which is
useful to accelerate computing speed when the magnitude of the data is large. The
default is FALSE.}

\item{model}{A string indicating the outcome model used to augment the Augmented
Synthetic Control Method. Augmentation through a prognostic function can improve
fit and reduce L2 imbalance metrics.
\itemize{
         \item{"None":}{ ASCM is not augmented by a prognostic function. Defualt.}
         \item{"Ridge":}{ Augments with a Ridge regression. Recommended to improve fit
                          for smaller panels (less than 40 locations and 100 time-stamps.))}
         \item{"GSYN":}{ Augments with a Generalized Synthetic Control Method. Recommended
                         to improve fit for larger panels (more than 40 locations and 100
                         time-stamps. }
         }}

\item{fixed_effects}{A logic flag indicating whether to include unit fixed
effects in the model. Set to TRUE by default.}

\item{ProgressBar}{A logic flag indicating whether to display a progress bar
to track progress. Set to FALSE by default.}

\item{parallel}{A logic flag indicating whether to use parallel computing to
speed up calculations. Set to TRUE by default.}

\item{parallel_setup}{A string indicating parallel workers set-up.
Set to "sequential" by default.}

\item{side_of_test}{A string indicating whether confidence will be determined
using a one sided or a two sided test.
\itemize{
         \item{"two_sided":}{ The test statistic is the sum of all treatment effects, i.e. sum(abs(x)). Defualt.}
         \item{"one_sided":}{ One-sided test against positive or negaative effects i.e.
         If the effect being applied is negative, then defaults to -sum(x). H0: ES >= 0; HA: ES < 0.
         If the effect being applied is positive, then defaults to sum(x). H0: ES <= 0; HA: ES > 0.}
         }}

\item{import_augsynth_from}{Points to where the augsynth package
should be imported from to send to the nodes.}
}
\value{
GeoLiftPower object that contains:
     \itemize{
         \item{"location":}{ Test units of the simulation}
         \item{"pvalue":}{ P Value for each simulation}
         \item{"duration":}{ Duration of the simulation}
