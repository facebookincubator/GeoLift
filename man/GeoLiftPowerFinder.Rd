\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame containing the historical conversions by
geographic unit, It requires a "locations" column with the geo name,
a "Y" column with the outcome data (units), a time column with the indicator
of the time period (starting at 1), and covariates.}

\item{treatment_periods}{List of treatment periods to calculate power for.}

\item{N}{List of number of test markets to calculate power for.}

\item{X}{List of names of covariates.}

\item{Y_id}{Name of the outcome variable (String).}

\item{location_id}{Name of the location variable (String).}

\item{time_id}{Name of the time variable (String).}

\item{effect_size}{A vector of effect sizes to test by default a
sequence between 0 - 25 percent in 5 percent increments: seq(0,0.25,0.05).
Only input sequences that are entirely positive or negative.}

\item{top_results}{Number of results to display.}

\item{alpha}{Significance Level. By default 0.1.}

\item{normalize}{A logic flag indicating whether to scale the outcome which is
useful to accelerate computing speed when the magnitude of the data is large. The
default is FALSE.}

\item{model}{A string indicating the outcome model used to augment the Augmented
Synthetic Control Method. Augmentation through a prognostic function can improve
fit and reduce L2 imbalance metrics.
\itemize{
         \item{"None":}{ ASCM is not augmented by a prognostic function. Defualt.}
         \item{"Ridge":}{ Augments with a Ridge regression. Recommended to improve fit
                          for smaller panels (less than 40 locations and 100 time-stamps.))}
         \item{"GSYN":}{ Augments with a Generalized Synthetic Control Method. Recommended
                         to improve fit for larger panels (more than 40 locations and 100
                         time-stamps. }
         }}

\item{fixed_effects}{A logic flag indicating whether to include unit fixed
effects in the model. Set to TRUE by default.}

\item{dtw}{Emphasis on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), dtw = 1 focuses exclusively
on this metric while dtw = 0 (default) relies on correlations only.}

\item{ProgressBar}{A logic flag indicating whether to display a progress bar
to track progress. Set to FALSE by default.}

\item{plot_best}{A logic flag indicating whether to plot the best 4 tests for
each treatment length. Set to FALSE by default.}

\item{run_stochastic_process}{A logic flag indicating whether to select test
markets through random sampling of the the similarity matrix. Given that
interpolation biases may be relevant if the synthetic control matches
the characteristics of the test unit by averaging away large discrepancies
between the characteristics of the test and the units in the synthetic controls,
it is recommended to only use random sampling after making sure all units are
similar. This parameter is set by default to FALSE.}

\item{parallel}{A logic flag indicating whether to use parallel computing to
speed up calculations. Set to TRUE by default.}

\item{parallel_setup}{A string indicating parallel workers set-up.
Set to "sequential" by default.}

\item{side_of_test}{A string indicating whether confidence will be determined
using a one sided or a two sided test.
\itemize{
         \item{"two_sided":}{ The test statistic is the sum of all treatment effects, i.e. sum(abs(x)). Defualt.}
         \item{"one_sided":}{ One-sided test against positive or negaative effects i.e. 
         If the effect being applied is negative, then defaults to -sum(x). H0: ES >= 0; HA: ES < 0.
         If the effect being applied is positive, then defaults to sum(x). H0: ES <= 0; HA: ES > 0.}
         }}

\item{import_augsynth_from}{Points to where the augsynth package
should be imported from to send to the nodes.}

average power.
