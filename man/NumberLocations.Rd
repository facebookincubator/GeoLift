\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame containing the historical conversions by
geographic unit. It requires a "locations" column with the geo name,
a "Y" column with the outcome data (units), a time column with the indicator
of the time period (starting at 1), and covariates.}

\item{number_locations}{List of number of locations to test. If not specified,
the number of locations will be computed by percentiles up to half of the
total number of locations.}

\item{treatment_periods}{Number of treatment periods.}

\item{n_sim}{Number of simulations.}

\item{X}{List of covariate names.}

\item{Y_id}{Name of the outcome variable (String).}

\item{location_id}{Name of the location variable (String).}

\item{time_id}{Name of the time variable (String).}

\item{plot}{Plots results when TRUE.}

\item{power}{Power level. By default 0.8.}

\item{alpha}{Significance Level. By default 0.1.}

\item{type}{Method of inference used in the analysis.
pValue=Provides conformal inference to provide the aggregate
p-value for the null hypothesis of no effect from the intervention.
The Default type is pValue.
Imbalance=Uses the model's Scaled L2 Imbalance metric.}

\item{normalize}{A logic flag indicating whether to scale the outcome which is
useful to accelerate computing speed when the magnitude of the data is large. The
default is FALSE.}

\item{model}{A string indicating the outcome model used to augment the Augmented
Synthetic Control Method. Augmentation through a prognostic function can improve
fit and reduce L2 imbalance metrics.
\itemize{
         \item{"None":}{ ASCM is not augmented by a prognostic function. Defualt.}
         \item{"Ridge":}{ Augments with a Ridge regression. Recommended to improve fit
                          for smaller panels (less than 40 locations and 100 time-stamps.))}
         \item{"GSYN":}{ Augments with a Generalized Synthetic Control Method. Recommended
                         to improve fit for larger panels (more than 40 locations and 100
                         time-stamps. }
         }}

\item{fixed_effects}{A logic flag indicating whether to include unit fixed
effects in the model. Set to TRUE by default.}

\item{stat_func}{Function to compute test statistic. NULL by default.}

\item{ProgressBar}{A logic flag indicating whether to display a progress bar
to track progress. Set to FALSE by default.}

\item{parallel}{A logic flag indicating whether to use parallel computing to
speed up calculations. Set to TRUE by default.}

\item{parallel_setup}{A string indicating parallel workers set-up.
Set to "sequential" by default.}

\item{import_augsynth_from}{Points to where the augsynth package
should be imported from to send to the nodes.}
