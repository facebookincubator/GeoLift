## What is GeoLift?

GeoLift is a research tool developed my Marketing Science team to run geo-based marketing experiments in cases where people-based measurement (Conversion Lift) is not feasible - for example, Healthcare advertisers.

Meta recommends its advertisers to use people-based experimentation where possible because it is a higher statistical power compared to geo-based experimentation.


## Getting Started

Get started by **[installing the GeoLift R package](https://github.com/facebookincubator/GeoLift)**.

Or try our **[GeoLift walkthrough](./GettingStarted/Walkthrough.md)**.
