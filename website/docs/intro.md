## What is GeoLift?
GeoLift is Meta's open-source solution used to measure Lift at a geographic level. This methodology leverages the latest developments in Synthetic Control Methods (SCM) to generate geographic quasi-experiments that measure the true incremental value of your marketing campaigns.

## Why GeoLift?
Five reasons why you should use GeoLift:
1. **It’s grounded in incrementality**, arguably the best indicator of return on investment.
2. **It’s an end-to-end solution**, spanning data ingestion, power calculations, test design, and more.​
3. **It’s flexible**. It’s useful across many use cases, including omni-channel and cross-channel measurement.
4. **It’s resilient**. It relies on data at a designated market area level, not personal information impacted by cookie loss.​
5. **It’s open source**. You can use it freely, build on top of it, collaborate with us, and replicate results.  ​
